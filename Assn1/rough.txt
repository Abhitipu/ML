Just like we do while creating a tree

Now, we'll have to store the data associated to that node class
i.e. the path that we get after that particular sequence of conjunctions

So we'll have to track the conjunctions

Woah woah woah woah, before that we need to have a root node!
The conjunction for the root node will be
