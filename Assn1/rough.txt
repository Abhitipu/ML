So I'll have to remove each node
And then I'll have to check what is the new accuracy value
The good thing is that after pruning you know the number of right answers and the number of wrong answers
So, there will be updates on our tree?
Select all nodes
cut and check improvement
How do I do this in an optimal manner?
What if I store 2 values?
1. The number of answers our child got right
2. The number of answers we got right if we wouldnt have referred to our child?

Or
What are the possible values??
Just think about it?

Remove each child and then predict.. can I somehow do it in O(n)?
Well... so I'll need to keep a count of the values it got right initially?
